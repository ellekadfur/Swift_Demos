Hello!


This project is a basic Movie List App written in swift using
https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/yitu-d5am/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD.

To run this project you will have to have Xcode. Once you launch the project, you'll see a list of locations that have been used in Movies in Hollywood:
-MVVM design pattern
-storyboard
-nibs
-autolayout
-Swift
-sf.gov API
-Sketch
-Illustrator
-obviously Foundation/UIKit
-blocks

To run the project on your machine:
1)Download or open Xcode
2)Build the project and the simulator show pop up!

Future Improvements:
- I will be add more in regards to error handling.
- And perhaps add more functionality.
- Complete a unique sketch design for funsies and practice.
- I should have created project, then used git from the start. Was in a rush, but love iterative development using Bitbucket, git, Jira, CodeReviews, etc.
