Hello!


Video Link:https://youtu.be/hcIj7OI7Tuw

This project is a basic Weather App written in Objective C & Swift  using
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/.

To run this project you will have to have Xcode. Once you launch the project, you'll see the current weather in Sunnyvale, CA for the next 5 days, starting with today. I have used:
-MVVM design pattern
-storyboard
-nibs
-autolayout
-objective-c & Swift
-Weather API
-Sketch
-Illustrator
-obviously Foundation/UIKit
-blocks

To run the project on your machine:
1)Download or open Xcode
2)Build the project and the simulator show pop up!

Future Improvements:
- In the future, I will create this same project in swift 4.
- I will be add more in regards to error handling.
- And perhaps add more funcationality.
- Complete a unquie sketch design for funsies and practice.
- I should have created project, then used git from the start. Was in a rush, but love iterative development using Bitbucket, git, Jira, CodeReviews, etc.
