Hello!


This project is a basic SQLite App written in Swift, will create in objective-c.

To run this project you will have to have Xcode. Once you launch the project, you'll see 2 textfields, you should enter values in them and click save. Then the tableview will be populated. I have used:
-SQLite3
-storyboard
-nibs
-autolayout
-Swift
-obviously Foundation/UIKit

To run the project on your machine:
1)Download or open Xcode
2)Build the project and the simulator should pop up!

Future Improvements:
- In the future, I will create this same project in swift 4.
- I will be add more in regards to error handling.
- And perhaps add more functionality.
- Complete a unique sketch design for funsies and practice.
- I should have created project, then used git from the start. Was in a rush, but love iterative development using Bitbucket, git, Jira, CodeReviews, etc.
